## DATA OPTIMIZATION APPROACH
Our YouTrack-Gemini integration will implement a focused data strategy to maximize analytical value while optimizing context usage:

1. OPEN/ACTIVE ISSUES: COMPLETE DATA DUMP
   - Extract 100% of data for all open/active issues
   - Include full comment history with timestamps and authors
   - Capture all activity logs (status changes, field updates, etc.)
   - Include all assignee history and transitions
   - Preserve complete relationship data (blockers, subtasks, dependencies)
   - Maintain all custom field values and their change history
   - Capture all sprint associations and movements
   - Include full description content including formatting and attachments
   - Preserve time tracking data for effort analysis

2. CLOSED ISSUES: STRATEGIC SUMMARY DATA
   - Basic metadata only (ID, summary, resolution date, final assignee)
   - Final resolution status and resolution type
   - Total time spent and time estimates for velocity analysis
   - Key milestone data for timeline context
   - Skip detailed comment history and activities for closed items
   - Exclude fine-grained tracking of past state transitions

## GEMINI CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION
This approach leverages Gemini 2.0 Flash's 1M token context window efficiently:
- Approximately 70-80% of context dedicated to active issues where action is possible
- Remaining 20-30% provides historical context from closed issues
- Prioritizes actionable information over historical record-keeping
- Enables deeper pattern recognition on in-progress work
- Maintains sufficient historical context for trend analysis

## ANALYTICAL BENEFITS
This focused approach provides several analytical advantages:
- Concentrates AI attention on issues where insights can drive immediate action
- Provides comprehensive context for current blockers and challenges
- Enables detailed workload analysis for active team members
- Maintains cycle time and throughput metrics from historical data
- Allows for sprint forecasting based on current velocity and capacity
- Preserves full communication context for open issues to identify miscommunications

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
When implementing this approach:
- Use YouTrack query filters to separate open vs. closed issue extraction
- Apply different field selectors based on issue state
- Consider time-based windowing for particularly large projects
- Ensure data consistency by using the same extraction timestamp
- Log counts of open vs. closed issues for context distribution monitoring
