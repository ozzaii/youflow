Query Syntax﻿
Last modified: 11 March 2025
To filter issues or tags that you receive from a server in response to your request, you need to specify the query parameter in the request.
You can only use queries in GET requests that work with collections of issues or tags.
When working with collections of issues, the query parameter represents a search query and has the same syntax with the adjustment for HTML symbols escaping for URIs. For details about YouTrack search queries, refer to the Search Query Reference.
When working with collections of tags, you can use the query parameter to filter a list of tags by the tag name.
Samples﻿
Let's see how queries work on a sample request for the issues list.
Request without Query Parameter﻿
First, let's get an unfiltered list of issues without the query parameter. Here's a sample request:
curl -X GET \
'https://example.youtrack.cloud/api/issues?fields=id,summary,project(name)' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer perm:amFuZS5kb2U=.UkVTVCBBUEk=.wcKuAok8cHmAtzjA6xlc4BrB4hleaX' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
In response, the server sends the following:
[
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Demo Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"Welcome to your YouTrack!",
    "id":"2-99",
    "$type":"Issue"
  },
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Demo Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"Create Issues",
    "id":"2-106",
    "$type":"Issue"
  },
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Sample Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"REST API lets you create issues!",
    "id":"2-142",
    "$type":"Issue"
  },
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Sample Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"Issue from REST #1",
    "id":"2-0",
    "$type":"Issue"
  }
]
Request with Query Parameter﻿
Now, let's use the query request parameter to filter the list of issues by the name of the project. Here's a sample request:
curl -X GET \
'https://example.youtrack.cloud/api/issues?fields=id,summary,project(name)&query=project:+%7BSample+Project%7D' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer perm:amFuZS5kb2U=.UkVTVCBBUEk=.wcKuAok8cHmAtzjA6xlc4BrB4hleaX' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
To the sample request with the query parameter, the response body contains data only for matching issues:
[
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Sample Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"REST API lets you create issues!",
    "id":"2-142",
    "$type":"Issue"
  },
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Sample Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"Issue from REST #1",
    "id":"2-0",
    "$type":"Issue"
  }
]
Finally, let's use a bit more complex query. Here, we are looking for issues that are assigned to the user "john.doe", are not yet resolved, and contain the word "summary". Here's a sample request:
curl -X GET \
'https://example.youtrack.cloud/api/issues?fields=id,summary,project(name)&query=for:+john.doe+%23Unresolved+summary' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer perm:amFuZS5kb2U=.UkVTVCBBUEk=.wcKuAok8cHmAtzjA6xlc4BrB4hleaX' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
Here's the response from the server:
[
  {
    "project":{
      "name":"Sample Project",
      "$type":"Project"
    },
    "summary":"New summary",
    "id":"2-42",
    "$type":"Issue"
  }
]
