## CORE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
We're building a daily reporting system that extracts comprehensive YouTrack data from the "MQ EIS/KG BSW (Mercedes)" project and uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to transform raw project data into high-value insights.

## GEMINI 2.0 FLASH INTEGRATION
- We'll leverage Gemini 2.0 Flash's 1M token context window to process complete project datasets
- Entire issue histories, comments, status changes, and relationships will be included in context
- This allows for deeper pattern recognition across the full project timeline
- API integration will be implemented with appropriate rate limiting and error handling

## DAILY INSIGHTS FOCUS
The system will generate a "Daily Project Pulse" that highlights:
- New issues created and their potential impact
- Status transitions and milestone achievements
- Blocked items and dependencies requiring attention
- Deviations from expected velocity or patterns
- Resource allocation changes and implications
- Approaching deadlines and completion forecasts

## TARGET AUDIENCE: PROJECT LEADS
- Reports assume deep familiarity with project structure and terminology
- Content focuses on exceptions, changes, and actionable insights
- Technical details are included without unnecessary explanation
- Emphasis on "what's changed since yesterday" rather than static status
- Insights should enable immediate action or decision-making

## DATA TRANSFORMATION APPROACH
Raw YouTrack data → Structured Analysis → Actionable Insights:
1. Extract complete issue data including metadata and relationships
2. Process temporal patterns (velocity changes, timing anomalies)
3. Identify blocking relationships and critical path impacts
4. Analyze resource allocation patterns and workload distribution
5. Compare current metrics against historical baselines
6. Generate natural language insights highlighting meaningful changes

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Daily report sent automatically at 8:00 AM
- Concise executive summary (3-5 bullet points of critical insights)
- Sectioned report with drill-down capabilities
- Visual indicators for priority items (RAG status markers)
- Ability to generate ad-hoc deeper analysis on specific areas
- Both email delivery and dashboard presentation
