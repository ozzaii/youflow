PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Create an intelligent system that extracts, processes, and analyzes YouTrack project data to generate automated, insightful reports and visualizations for the "MQ EIS/KG BSW (Mercedes)" project, enhancing project visibility and decision-making capabilities.

BUSINESS VALUE:
1. Reduce manual reporting overhead by automating status reports
2. Increase transparency into project health and progress
3. Enable data-driven decision making through AI-powered insights
4. Standardize reporting formats for consistent communication
5. Identify potential bottlenecks and risks before they impact delivery

TECHNICAL GOALS:
1. Build a reliable data pipeline from YouTrack to our systems
2. Implement a RAG-based AI system that understands project context
3. Create standardized report templates that maintain consistency
4. Develop interactive visualizations for complex project data
5. Establish a scheduled delivery system for reports

USER STORIES:
1. As a project manager, I need automated status reports so I can focus on addressing issues rather than compiling data
2. As a team lead, I need visualizations of team workload and progress to optimize resource allocation
3. As a stakeholder, I need standardized reports to quickly understand project health
4. As an executive, I need trend analysis to make strategic decisions about project direction

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. System reliably extracts complete and accurate data from YouTrack
2. Reports contain relevant insights about project status, not just raw data
3. Visualizations clearly communicate complex relationships and trends
4. Reports are delivered on schedule to the correct recipients
5. Information is presented in a standardized, easily consumable format

LONG-TERM VISION:
This system will evolve into a comprehensive project intelligence platform that not only reports on current status but provides predictive insights, automated recommendations, and serves as an AI-powered project assistant that can answer complex questions about project health and trajectory.
