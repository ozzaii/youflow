I need you to help me extract and organize issue data from the YouTrack API for our "MQ EIS/KG BSW (Mercedes)" project. This is Phase 1 of our AI integration project, focusing on comprehensive data extraction.

## OBJECTIVE
Create a Python script that connects to our YouTrack instance, authenticates properly, and extracts ALL issue-related data for the "MQ EIS/KG BSW (Mercedes)" project, with special focus on assignees, status changes, and custom fields.

## AUTHENTICATION DETAILS
- YouTrack Instance: [URL TO YOUR YOUTRACK INSTANCE]
- Authentication Method: [SPECIFY: Permanent Token/OAuth/Basic Auth]
- [If you have a token or credentials stored in environment variables, mention how they're configured]

## DATA REQUIREMENTS
Extract the following information for EACH issue:
1. Issue ID and summary
2. Current status and all historical status changes with timestamps
3. Assignee(s) - current and historical
4. Created date, resolved date (if applicable)
5. All comments with author and timestamp
6. Sprint information (if available)
7. All custom fields and their values
8. All tags/labels
9. All relationships with other issues (dependencies, subtasks, etc.)
10. Time tracking information (if available)

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Structure the extracted data as a JSON file with the following schema:
- Issues as the top-level array
- Each issue should contain nested objects for status history, comments, etc.
- Maintain all relationships between issues
- Include proper error handling and logging

## SPECIFIC CHALLENGES
- The YouTrack API can be inconsistent - implement robust error handling and retry logic
- Some custom fields may have complex structures - ensure complete extraction
- Rate limiting might be an issue - implement appropriate throttling

## CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Use modern Python (3.9+)
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and status updates
- Use async where appropriate for performance
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Structure the code for maintainability and future extensions
