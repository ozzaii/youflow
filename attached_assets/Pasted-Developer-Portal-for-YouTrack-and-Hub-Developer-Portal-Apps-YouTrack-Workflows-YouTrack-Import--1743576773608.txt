REST API URL and Endpoints﻿
Last modified: 11 March 2025
YouTrack's REST API is available by the following URL:
{YouTrack-Service-URL}/api
YouTrack Server REST API URL﻿
<YouTrack Service URL> is the base URL of the YouTrack service in your network environment. For example, you have your company's server www.example.com and a YouTrack service. You can configure YouTrack to be accessible by www.example.com/youtrack or, let's say youtrack.example.com.
/api is the context path for the REST API of your YouTrack service. Append this path to the YouTrack service URL to get the URL for the REST API.
For the sample service URLs above, REST API URLs are as follows:
YouTrack Service URL
YouTrack REST API URL
https://www.example.com/youtrack	https://www.example.com/youtrack/api
https://youtrack.example.com	https://youtrack.example.com/api
Here are the examples of the endpoint URLs to get the profile of the current user:
For www.example.com/youtrack:
https://www.example.com/youtrack/api/users/me
For youtrack.example.com:
https://youtrack.example.com/api/users/me
YouTrack Cloud REST API URL﻿
<YouTrack Service URL> is the base URL of your YouTrack Cloud instance.
If your YouTrack Cloud instance is hosted on myjetbrains.com, its service URL must have the /youtrack context appended. For example, https://example.myjetbrains.com/youtrack.
/api is the context path for the REST API of your YouTrack service. Append this path to the YouTrack service URL to get the URL for the REST API.
For the instances hosted on default YouTrack Cloud domains, REST API URLs are as follows:
YouTrack Service URL
YouTrack REST API URL
https://example.youtrack.cloud	https://example.youtrack.cloud/api
https://example.myjetbrains.com/youtrack	https://example.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/api
Here are the examples of the endpoint URLs to get the profile of the current user:
For example.youtrack.cloud:
https://example.youtrack.cloud/api/users/me
For example.myjetbrains.com:
https://example.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/api/users/me
Custom Endpoints﻿
Custom REST endpoints are user-defined endpoints that let you extend the YouTrack REST API. Custom endpoints can be added to YouTrack by installing an app that contains one or more HTTP Handlers. These custom endpoints let you introduce additional capabilities into the YouTrack REST API to meet your specific needs.
When you call a custom REST endpoint, you invoke its corresponding HTTP handler. The endpoints used are based on the scope property assigned to the handler.
Scope
URL
issue	
<host>/api/issues/<issueId>/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint
article	
<host>/api/articles/<articleId>/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint
project	
<host>/api/admin/projects/<projectId>/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint
user	
<host>/api/users/<userId>/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint
global	
<host>/api/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint
Set the following variables to match your app:
app — the name of your app.
handler — the name of the file that contains the HTTP handler script in the app package without the .js file extension.
endpoint — the path from the declaration. For example, "path": "/endpoint"
Each API request requires the same permissions as the scope entity. For example, the endpoint /api/issues/DEMO-1/extensionEndpoints/app/handler/endpoint is accessible to any user who has permission to access the issue with the ID DEMO-1. Global endpoints are accessible to all users except the guest account.
