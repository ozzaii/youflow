## PROJECT BACKGROUND
This initiative aims to transform how we manage and report on the Mercedes project "MQ EIS/KG BSW" within our organization. Currently, project reporting is manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent, leading to delayed insights and reactive management. YouTrack serves as our primary project management tool, containing rich data that remains largely untapped for analytics and reporting purposes.

## TECHNICAL LANDSCAPE
YouTrack's API presents several challenges:
- Complex data structures with nested relationships between entities
- Inconsistent response formats across different endpoints
- Rate limiting that requires careful request management
- Limited documentation on advanced query capabilities
- Custom fields specific to our organization that require special handling

Our development stack includes Python for backend processing, with potential use of frameworks like FastAPI or Flask for service endpoints. We're considering vector databases (Pinecone/Qdrant) for the RAG implementation, and visualization libraries like Plotly or D3.js for the interactive dashboards.

## BUSINESS CONTEXT
The "MQ EIS/KG BSW (Mercedes)" project is a strategic initiative with high visibility among executives. It involves:
- Multiple development teams across different locations
- Strict delivery timelines with contractual obligations
- Complex interdependencies between components
- Custom development workflows reflected in YouTrack fields
- Reporting requirements to both internal and client stakeholders

Project stakeholders need regular, standardized updates on:
- Sprint completion rates and velocity
- Issue resolution metrics and bottlenecks
- Resource allocation and capacity
- Risk identification and mitigation status
- Timeline adherence and milestone tracking

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
The solution must:
- Operate with minimal manual intervention
- Handle the extraction of complete project data without data loss
- Process information securely, respecting access controls
- Generate reports in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, and spoken audio)
- Maintain historical data for trend analysis
- Provide both scheduled reports and on-demand generation
- Scale to accommodate growing project data volume
- Support customization of report templates

## EXPECTED CHALLENGES
- YouTrack's API pagination requires careful handling to ensure complete data extraction
- Custom field mappings may change over time and need adaptive handling
- Large volumes of historical data may impact performance
- Ensuring consistent data quality despite API inconsistencies
- Balancing detail with clarity in automated reports

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
We're implementing a RAG-based approach because:
- Project data contains domain-specific terminology and context
- Historical context is crucial for accurate reporting
- We need to support natural language queries about project status
- Standard templates may not address all stakeholder questions
- The system must understand the relationships between different data points

## INNOVATION GOALS
Beyond basic reporting, we aim to:
- Implement predictive analytics for sprint planning
- Develop natural language interfaces for project queries
- Create adaptive reporting that focuses on areas needing attention
- Build a knowledge base that captures project patterns and insights
- Eventually expand to other projects with minimal reconfiguration
