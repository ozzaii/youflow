Follow-up Questions
â€¢ 1. Why are there 58 stale issues, and what steps can be taken to resolve them quickly? What is the impact of these stale issues on the project?

â€¢ 2. The average resolution time is 0 days. Is this accurate, and if so, how is this possible given the number of open and stale issues? If not, what is the real average resolution time?

â€¢ 3. The recent activity, activity by field, and most active users are empty. Is data collection working correctly for these metrics, and if not, how can we fix it to gain better insights into team activity?

â€¢ 4. The majority of recent issues are related to the KG subsystem and reported by Tahir Tenbih. Is there a specific problem or bottleneck in this area that needs to be addressed?

â€¢ 5. The dates in the recent issue samples are showing as "1970-01-01". Is this a data error, and if so, how can we correct it to accurately track issue creation, updates, and resolution times?
